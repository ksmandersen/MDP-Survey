\subsection{Examples: Figures}

For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.

Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
your source.

Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.

To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable
quality, we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as
pronounced as possible.

If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
the print quality before you send the files.

Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".

\paragraph{Remark 1.}

In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is
prepared to cover the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored
pictures accepted. Colored pictures are welcome in the electronic
version free of charge. If you send colored figures that are to be
printed in black and white, please make sure that they really are
legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.

\subsection{Formulas}

Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
\begin{equation}
  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
\end{equation}

Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

\subsection{Footnotes}

The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
the
normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}

\subsection{Program Code}

Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

end.

\subsection{Citations}

For citations in the text please use
square brackets and consecutive numbers: \cite{jour}, \cite{lncschap},
\cite{proceeding1} -- provided automatically
by \LaTeX 's \verb|\cite| \dots\verb|\bibitem| mechanism.

\subsection{Page Numbering and Running Heads}

There is no need to include page numbers. If your paper title is too
long to serve as a running head, it will be shortened. Your suggestion
as to how to shorten it would be most welcome.
